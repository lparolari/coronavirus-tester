> Are you affected by COVID-19? Do the test!

Nomore expensive swabs or queues in the emergency room: from now you 
can discover if you are affected by COVID-19 or not.

The only thing you have to do is let *coronavirus-tester* scans your
finger, elaborate the data and let you know if you are affected or not.
